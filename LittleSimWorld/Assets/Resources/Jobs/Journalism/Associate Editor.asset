  Description: "Now you are responsible for the quality, consistency, and impact
    of journals in the research community. This is achieved by selecting qualified,
    independent and experienced reviewers to review the submitted manuscripts, and
    by efficiently managing the peer-review process. You will also be managing some
    of the people below you, and socializing with far more people during your day.
    All this does lead to making more money, but unfortunately, your work hours dramatically
    increase as well. But truth be told, it\u2019s not really hard type of work,
    work."
