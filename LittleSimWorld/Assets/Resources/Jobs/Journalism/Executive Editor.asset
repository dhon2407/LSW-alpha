  Description: Welcome to the big leagues. Your job now will be to organize, supervise,
    and participate in the management and development of all copy submitted for publication.
    That means you will work with editors and designers on the development of the
    editorial calendar and set and enforce deadlines for copy. Well paid, long hours,
    lots of socializing, if you can call it that. But hey, you are actually a respected
    person now. Seems like your not so hard work paid off. Now your job is easier,
    but it still eats a large chunk of your day.
