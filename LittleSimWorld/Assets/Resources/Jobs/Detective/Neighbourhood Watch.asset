  Description: You have joined a neighbourhood crime watch. Its volunteer work technically,
    but the neighbourhood puts together some donation money so you can afford to
    keep spending your time on it. You take long walks with your trusty flashlight
    and phone, to call the police in case of necessity. Remember to always walk in
    pairs. Some super heroes had similar origin stories...
